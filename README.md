# Bigmak

A custom keyboard layout I've been trying out. 
It's a variation on the relatively popular Colemak-DH layout.

Requires AutoHotKey to work. 

Includes some quality of life changes specific to my keyboard and what I want, but it can easily be altered to suit one's needs with basic AHK knowledge.
